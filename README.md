Menaut App
This project is a website that can store and collect data, in this case a user with a name, an email, a username and a password, from a database.
The database is running in mongodb and is local.

The web it self is made by a home, login, register, dashboard and a profile page. For going into the dashboard or the profile you need to be registered. The profile only show the name, the username and the email. The dashboard show 3 images like a second shop app.
There is also a logout button in the navbar when you are registered.

If in the register page the email has an invalid format, you wont be able to register and a error message will show up. In the login page there are error messages if the username is wrong or if the password is worng.

For running the web you have to open the project you have to open it in local because the deployment in Heroku needs to be paying.
If you have it in local, just dowload the dependencies writing in the terminal npm install. Then you just write nodemon in the terminal and the app should be working.

To see the web you type in google http://localhost:8080/ or the number that port shows in the terminal
